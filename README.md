# CoVID19 Findings
![image](report/images/clustering%20pairplot.png)

This is a project on Data Mining and Machine Learning for the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department of the University of Patras.

Brought to you by Ioannis Loudaros and Christina Kratimenou.

We explore CovID19 Data of different countries to draw some conclusions about the features that played key roles on the fight with the pandemic. 

We then try to do a clustering of those countries based on their efficiency against CovID19.

Finaly, we train some regressors, with which we try to predict CovID19 spread in each country.

You can find the report with our conclusions [here](https://github.com/iloudaros/Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/report/Report.pdf), and a Jupiter Notebook with our implementation [here](https://github.com/iloudaros/Data-Mining-and-Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/CoVID19_findings.ipynb).
